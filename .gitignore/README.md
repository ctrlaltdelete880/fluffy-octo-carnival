Not sure what I am doing, but I am trying to learn how to program and this is my first attempt.
Basically I was trying to do a Mammoth Interactive 30 Min Tutorial and I needed to use JSbin, then it wouldn't let me log on without going through GIT HUB and now I am totally lost

Ok, So I think I am getting the hang of this but I don't know what I am doing still.
But I like Tacos too.
